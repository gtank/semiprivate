A toy implementation of Zooko and Brian Warner's cryptographic permissions
hierarchy for a mutable file as described in "Tahoe â€“ The Least-Authority
Filesystem".

This is NOT AT ALL suitable for use. It's intended as a simplified sketch of
the idea for myself or other interested developers and lacks most of the
desirable traits of production cryptography.
